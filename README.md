# hypothesis-testing
Does some of the steps for conducting a hypothesis test using the binomial distribution, you still have to determine the null and alternative hypothesis yourself.  
Not the cleanest code I've ever written but it hopefully is somewhat understandable  
You can run without installing scala on your machine by going to https://repl.it/@rorysharp/AttachedExhaustedGame, clicking the run button and being patient
